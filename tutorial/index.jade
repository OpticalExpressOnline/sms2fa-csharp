    ## About this Application

    This [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/mvc) application example
    demonstrates how to implement an SMS two-factor authentication using Twilio.

    _To run this application yourself [download the code and follow the
    instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/TwilioDevEd/sms2fa-csharp)._

    Adding two-factor authentication (2FA) to your web application increases the
    security of your user's data. [Multi-factor
    authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)
    determines the identity of a user in two steps: 

    1. First we validate the user with an email and password

    2. Second, we validate using a mobile device, by sending them a one-time **verification code**.

    Once our user enters the verification code, we know they have received the SMS, and indeed are who they say they are. This is a standard SMS implementation.

    For a slightly more advanced implementation using [Authy](https://www.twilio.com/authy) One-Touch checkout this [tutorial](//www.twilio.com/docs/tutorials/walkthrough/two-factor-authentication/python/flask).

    Let's get started!

    ## Adding Two-Factor Authentication

    This application uses [ASP.NET
    Identity](//www.asp.net/identity/overview/getting-started/introduction-to-aspnet-identity)
    to manage authentication.

    The Twilio helper library allows us to easily send an SMS.

    First we have to create an instance of a **Twilio Rest Client** with our
    credentials. Now all we have to do to send an SMS using the REST API is to call `client.messages.create()` with the necessary parameters.

    You can find your credentials at your [Twilio Account](//www.twilio.com/user/account/phone-numbers/incoming).

    ## Registering a Two-Factor Provider

    We use `manager`, which is an instance of the `ApplicationUserManager` to
    register the `PhoneNumberTokenProvider` to send text messages.
